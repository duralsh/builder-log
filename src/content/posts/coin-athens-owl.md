The Athenian owl is iconic for a reason: it compresses economics, identity, and geopolitical reach into a single object.

For this piece, I documented:

- Weight, diameter, and flan shape.
- Helmet, eye, and owl style markers.
- Provenance references and auction comparables.

Collecting gets more interesting when each coin becomes a small research project.
