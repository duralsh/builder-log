Perps are unforgiving UX territory: one extra step can create expensive mistakes.

We focused on:

- Fast path defaults for common order types.
- Explicit risk visibility before confirmation.
- Robust edge-case handling for thin liquidity and rapid price movement.

In the first month after launch, the product crossed **$100M** in volume.
