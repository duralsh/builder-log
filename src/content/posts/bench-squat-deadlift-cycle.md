The most important variable in my lifting progress is not program complexity, it is consistency.

This cycle used a simple progression model:

- 4 training days per week.
- Main lift top set + backoff structure.
- Weekly volume checks to avoid fatigue spillover.

Three useful reminders from this block:

1. Sleep quality predicts performance better than motivation.
2. Technique videos are underrated.
3. Deload timing is part of progress, not a pause from progress.
