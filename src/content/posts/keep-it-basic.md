I train 5-6 days a week, rotating through what feels right rather than following a rigid program.

Lower body gets hit 1-2 times weekly, either at home with kettlebells or at the gym.

Upper body work - chest and back - happens once a week at the gym.

Core training happens twice weekly, one session heavy and one moderate.

Arms and shoulders get their own day once a week.

Neck and traps are trained when I feel like it.

The approach is intuitive.

If something feels off, I skip it or adjust.

Volume drops when I'm tired.

Recovery matters more than checking boxes.

Boxing fits in when it can.

Sometimes that's regular, sometimes it's not.

It depends on schedule and how my body is responding to everything else.

Food is mostly organic and high protein.

I try to buy from local farms when possible - better quality, supports the local economy, and I know where it's coming from.

Nothing strict or obsessive about it, just a preference that has stuck.

The whole setup works because it's flexible.

I train around life instead of forcing life around training.
