This coin appealed to me for both condition and historical context.

Highlights:

- Crisp imperial portrait with strong legend legibility.
- Reverse type with clear strike characteristics.
- A useful example from a turbulent but administratively significant reign.

I treat each acquisition as a study object first and a collectible second.
