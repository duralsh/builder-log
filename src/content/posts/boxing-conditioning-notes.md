Boxing sharpened my relationship with effort pacing.

A weekly structure that works well:

- Two high-intensity interval sessions.
- One longer aerobic piece.
- Technique rounds on separate days from heavy lower-body sessions.

If I over-index on intensity, lifting quality drops first. Balancing modalities requires planning recovery as carefully as planning effort.
